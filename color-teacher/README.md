WHAT IS COLOR TEACHER ABOUT?
- Teaches users to recognize different colors and test their knowledge afterwards
- - it first teaches by displaying a color 
- - mention the color's name (This is color red)
- - Wait for 3 seconds
- - Ask user to paint the box below (Paint the box below with color red)
- - Then displays (Good job üëç) if user paints the box completely
- - repeats for all colors in the array
- Test picks color from the array randomly
- - Displays a color and Asks (What color is this)
- - Wait for 3 seconds then says (It is color red)
- - Now paint the box below with color red
- - Then displays (Good job üëç) if user paints the box completely
- - picks another color randomly from the array

MORE FEATURES I GOT ALONG THE LINE
- Improve the interface to a better one
- Add both primary and seconday color 
- Teach, Test and grade(score) based on perfomance in the test. Recommend to retake test or lesson
- - test can be: Ask 'What color is this (Showing a red box)? 
- - give 2 button options saying red | blue 


I THINK THE MAIN WORK IN THIS TEST AND OPTIONS SECTION IS 
HOW TO BRING THE RIGHT AND WRONG OPTIONS TO EXISTENCE - Lets do it!
if array[0] is the color
oneA option is given array[0]
oneB option is givent array[a number picked at random between 0 and arraylenght, if it is array[0] then repick another number till ect]

oneA option is given to one of the two buttons at random

- - lets convert the ideas above to code and see how it goes --- Lets go!


HOW I PLAN THE OPTION BUTTONS TO WORK
if wrong option clicked
No! The color is red.
Try again - rerun the random color selection


if right option is clicked
Yes! The color is red.
Now paint the box below with red
- display the artboard
