WHAT IS COLOR TEACHER ABOUT?
- Teaches users to recognize different colors and test their knowledge afterwards
- - it first teaches by displaying a color 
- - mention the color's name (This is color red)
- - Wait for 3 seconds
- - Ask user to paint the box below (Paint the box below with color red)
